# EasyAS_Readme

## Description

As a Developer I wanted to develop a README.md generator so I could quickly generate a professional README.
I was motivated to automate the process of creating a README file for every project.
I built this app to reduce the amount of time needed to create a professional README file.
This app eliminates the tedious task of having to create a professional README from scratch. easyAS_Readme captures user input using prompts to develop a profession README.
